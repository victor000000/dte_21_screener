"""clock.py — COMPATIBILITY SHIM. The real module is data.clock.

Kept so both invocation styles keep working during the data/application split:

    uv run python scripts/clock.py ...   (forwards to __main__)
    import clock                                                    (aliases the real module)

Is anything still using this? `python scripts/shim_status.py` answers it.
Do NOT hand-grep for the name: the shim's own docstring contains it, so the
grep always finds this file -- and the real module's usage example names the
old path too. Both were counted as "referenced" for months.
That tool sees IN-REPO references only. A shim is also an entry point a human
or an external script may call by path, which no grep can see, so treat its
"no references" as necessary, not sufficient.

    #     because it skips underscore-prefixed names;
