"""Tests for shard_link.link_up — the gateway probe that overrides the logs.

This guards the 2026-10-11 failure: the gateway refused every port from 05:14 and the sweep
ran until 07:53 reporting `processed=2 errors=0 ratio=0.0%`, because a shard on a dead link
still logs the occasional "no bars" and the controller counts that as work. The probe is the
signal that cannot be faked, so what it must never do is RAISE: a supervisor taken down by its
own health check is worse off than one that is merely blind.
