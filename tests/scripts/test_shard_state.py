"""Tests for shard_state — has this shard already finished its pass?

The distinction this file exists for: a `done:` from a PREVIOUS run must not count. If it
did, a sweep restarted after a crash would skip a shard that had finished one pass and then
died, and the symbols it never reached would silently never be fetched — a gap created by
the very mechanism meant to save time.
