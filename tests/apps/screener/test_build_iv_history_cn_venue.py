"""test_build_iv_history_cn_venue.py — the wiring between a venue and its frame parser.

The one thing that can go quietly wrong here is the mapping: SHFE and GFEX report the same
concept in DIFFERENT units (a fraction and a percent), so a parser pointed at the wrong
venue's frames yields an IV series that is 100x off and still looks like a number.
