"""A literal Schwab Account Statement, small enough to read.

Every parser test loads this rather than the account, so the expected values are the
FILE's own numbers -- which is what makes "did the parse change?" answerable without a
broker. The rows are verbatim from 2026-10-06, including the two shapes that caused
real bugs: a spread whose second leg has a BLANK exec time, and a price written as
`.27` with no leading zero.

Column layouts differ per section and the leading blank column is easy to miss:
  Trade History : ,Exec Time,Spread,Side,Qty,Pos Effect,Symbol,Exp,Strike,Type,Price,Net Price,Order Type
  Order History : Notes,,Time Placed,Spread,Side,Qty,Pos Effect,Symbol,Exp,Strike,Type,PRICE,,TIF,Status
