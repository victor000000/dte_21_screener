"""Which spreadsheet column is which schema column.

THE BUG. `journal_entries` had no `major_plan` column, and the loader mapped the first
eight cells POSITIONALLY onto the eight narrative columns. The sheet's fifth column is
"major plan", so from there on everything was shifted by one on every row ever loaded:
`alt_assumptions` held the plan, `confidence` held the alternative, and so on. No column
was empty and nothing failed -- each was full of the wrong text, which is why it lasted.
