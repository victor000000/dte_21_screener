"""The execution and order parsers -- both of which shipped recording half the truth.

TWO BUGS, both silent, both found by printing what was parsed.
 1. A spread is TWO ROWS and only the first carries the exec time; Schwab leaves
    Time/Spread/Net blank on the second leg. Skipping rows without a time recorded one
    leg of every spread -- and the missing leg is the one that makes the position whole.
    A day of strangles came through as a set of naked short calls.
 2. The Order History's own column layout has a leading blank field, so reading the
    time at index 1 (right for Trade History) matched nothing: a day with 30 orders
    parsed as zero, and the eleven REJECTED-for-buying-power rows went unrecorded.
