"""test_cn_expiry.py — the CN option expiry rules, pinned to measured last trading days.

Every date below was measured on 2026-10-07 from the contract's own history: the last day it
traded with a nonzero volume (Sina), read against `tool_trade_date_hist_sina`. The old rules
were 7-11 days early on SHFE and DCE, and because T enters every greek as sqrt(T) that is
~15% of IV on a front-month option -- a wrong P&L, not an error message.

SOME OF THESE ARE OFF BY A DAY, deliberately and visibly: the weekday counters skip weekends,
not CN holidays (April 2025 has Qingming). They are asserted as "within one day" rather than
as equality so that nobody later reads the exact values as the rule.
