"""A quote is live only while it is RECENT.

`quote_class` and `is_realtime` are stamped by the fetch when the quote is CAPTURED. A
pricing layer that reads them back later without looking at the clock reports what the
quote WAS, not what it is.

Measured 2026-10-06: `fetch_extended_hours_prices` last ran at 13:46 and TWS then went
down, so the 17:20 build priced four underlyings off a 214-minute-old quote -- every one
still labelled `live` with `is_realtime=True`. The report said "every underlying priced
in real time" while CRWD had moved 1.53% since the price the whole book was struck at.
The ordering clause in the query ranks recent quotes first; it cannot help when nothing
recent exists, and it never touched the label.
