"""test_net.py — retry, and the fact that net's re-exports really are the same objects.

net.py is now the front door for three concerns: retry (its own), the rate gate
(ratelimit.py) and the progress files (progress.py). It re-exports the other two so the 26
modules doing `from shared.net import throttle, status` keep working — and that only holds
while they are ALIASES. A copy would drift, and the copy is the one nobody tests, which is
the failure this file exists to catch.
